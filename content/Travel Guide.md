 > Suburban Train: Take a local train from Sealdah Railway Station (in Kolkata) to Kalyani Main or Kanchrapara. These trains are frequent and cost-effective. Once you reach Kalyani, you can take an auto-rickshaw, cycle-rickshaw, or bus to the college.
 
 > Kalyani Main: From here, it's a short auto-rickshaw ride/ toto to the college.

 > Local Buses: Once in Kalyani, there are local buses and mini buses that can drop you near the college.

 #### ![üöå](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///wAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==)By Metro & Bus/ Train Combination
 
 > Metro: Take the Kolkata Metro to Dum Dum or Belgachia station.
 
 > From Dum Dum: Take a local train from Dum Dum Junction to Kalyani.
 
 > From Belgachia: Take a bus to the nearest train station (like Sealdah) and then a train to Kalyani.
 
 #### ![üöï](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///wAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==)By Taxi/ Cab
 
 > App-Based Cabs: You can book an app-based cab from Kolkata or any nearby city directly to JIS College of Engineering. This is more convenient but costlier than other public transport options. Here are some options you can look at, though OLA operates in West Bengal, we suggest not to book cabs as mostly they will cancel your ride/ overcharge.
