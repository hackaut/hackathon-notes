## Problem Statements

### Agriculture:
1. **Blockchain for Supply Chain Transparency**  
   Create a blockchain-based software solution to ensure transparency and traceability in the agricultural supply chain, from farm to consumer, helping prevent fraud and ensuring food quality.

2. **Mobile App for Market Price Forecasting**  
   Design a mobile app that uses machine learning to forecast market prices for agricultural commodities, helping farmers make informed decisions about when and where to sell their produce.

3. **Pest and Disease Prediction Software using Machine Learning**  
   Build a machine learning model that predicts pest outbreaks or crop diseases based on environmental conditions, satellite data, and past incidents, delivering real-time alerts to farmers through a mobile app.

### Medical:
1. **AI-based Medical Imaging Diagnostics**  
   Develop software that uses deep learning algorithms to analyze medical images (X-rays, MRIs, CT scans) and assist doctors in diagnosing conditions such as tumors, fractures, or infections.

2. **Patient Management and Scheduling System**  
   Create a software system for hospitals and clinics that efficiently manages patient records, appointments, and schedules while incorporating telemedicine features to optimize healthcare delivery.

3. **Medical Data Interoperability Platform**  
   Develop a secure, interoperable software solution that allows different healthcare providers (hospitals, labs, clinics) to share and access patient records in a standardized format, enhancing care coordination.
### Education:
1. **AI-based Learning Content Recommendation System**  
   Build a recommendation engine that personalises learning content for students based on their progress, learning style, and preferences, helping them study more effectively on e-learning platforms.

2. **Automated Grading System for Coding Assignments**  
   Create a software solution that automatically grades coding assignments based on code quality, efficiency, and correctness, providing instant feedback to students and easing the workload for educators.

3. **Virtual Classroom Platform with AI Tutoring**  
   Develop a virtual classroom platform that incorporates AI-driven tutoring assistants to help students with homework, assignments, and test preparation, providing personalised support outside of class hours.

4. **Blockchain-based Credential Verification System**  
   Build a blockchain-based platform to securely store and verify academic credentials and certificates, reducing fraud and simplifying the job application process for both students and employers.
### Open Innovation

 The Open Innovation category invites participants to explore creative and groundbreaking ideas that do not fall into predefined themes or industries. Whether you have an idea that disrupts an existing market or a novel solution to a unique problem, this is your space to shine. The goal is to foster creativity and innovation by providing a platform for unconventional and transformative projects.
